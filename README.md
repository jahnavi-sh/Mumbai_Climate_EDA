# Air Quality Analysis in Mumbai (Jan-July 2022)

## Overview
This Python script performs an in-depth analysis of Mumbai's air quality from January to July 2022. Utilizing two datasets (`air_quality_index_mumbai.csv` and `temp_and_precipitation_mumbai.csv`), it provides valuable insights into the relationship between air pollutants, weather conditions, and the Air Quality Index (AQI). The analysis includes data resampling, imputation, and interactive visualizations for comprehensive exploration.

## Features and Techniques Used

### 1. Data Resampling and Imputation
- **Data Resampling:** Daily resampling ensures uniformity, enabling accurate analysis across time.
- **Data Imputation:** Forward filling is used to handle missing data, preserving temporal patterns.

### 2. Interactive Visualizations
- **Heatmaps:** Interactive heatmaps visualize pollutant levels over time, revealing trends and fluctuations.
- **Bubble Charts:** Bubble charts depict PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, emphasizing high-pollution days.
- **Ternary Plot:** Displays the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and PM10 levels on specific days.
- **Polar Plot:** Represents AQI correlation with major pollutants, offering a clear overview of their relationships.

### 3. Libraries Utilized

#### a. **NumPy**
- **Purpose:** Efficient numerical operations, array manipulations, and calculations.
- **Benefits:** Enhances performance and handles large datasets and complex math operations seamlessly.

#### b. **Pandas**
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive data manipulation, including cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies data exploration, enabling easy tabular data handling and integration with other libraries.

#### c. **Plotly**
- **Purpose:** Creates interactive, visually appealing plots.
- **Benefits:** Enhances user experience, allowing exploration within plots. Versatile for diverse visualizations.

#### d. **Datetime**
- **Purpose:** Handles date and time data for accurate time-based analysis.
- **Benefits:** Enables seamless integration with time series data and creation of insightful temporal visualizations.
